# Basic non-visual elements for Polymer.dart

A port of polymer.js' [polymer-elements](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-elements) to Polymer.dart. 
The intent of the authors is to contribute the work to the Dart project itself (https://www.dartlang.org).

### Visual elements for Dart can be found in
* [polymer_ui_elements](https://github.com/ErikGrimes/polymer_ui_elements)

## Documentation
* [DartDoc](http://erikgrimes.github.io/polymer_elements/docs/index.html)

## General notes

* Current development status requires [Dart SDK build 29746](http://gsdview.appspot.com/dart-editor-archive-continuous/29746/) (0.8.10.0)
