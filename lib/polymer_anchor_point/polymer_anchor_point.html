/**
 * polymer-anchor-point can be used to align two nodes. The node to
 * use as the reference position is the anchor node, and the node to
 * be positioned is the target node.
 *
 * Both the anchor and target nodes should have an anchor-point
 * attribute. The target node is positioned such that its anchor-point
 * aligns with the anchor node's anchor-point.
 *
 * Note: The target node is positioned with position: fixed, and will not
 * scroll with the page.
 *
 * Note: This is meant to polyfill the `<dialog>` positioning behavior when
 * an anchor is provided. Spec: http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/commands.html#the-dialog-element
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     <div id="anchor" anchor-point="bottom left"></div>
 *     <div id="target" anchor-point="top left"></div>
 *     <polymer-anchor-point id="anchor-helper"></polymer-anchor-point>
 *     <script>
 *       var helper = document.querySelector('#anchor-helper');
 *       helper.anchor = document.querySelector('#anchor');
 *       helper.target = document.querySelector('#target');
 *       helper.apply();
 *     </script>
 *
 * @class polymer-anchor-point
