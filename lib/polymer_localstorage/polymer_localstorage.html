/**
 * polymer-localstorage provides access to localStorage.  The "name" property
 * is the key to the data ("value" property) stored in localStorage.
 *
 * polymer-localstorage automatically saves the value to localStorage when
 * value is changed.  Note that if value is an object auto-save will be
 * triggered only when value is a different instance.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     <polymer-localstorage name="my-app-storage" value="{{value}}"></polymer-localstorage>
 *
 * @class polymer-localstorage

 * Fired after it is loaded from localStorage.
